HOW TO RUN MISTRA -- in a nutshell:
-----------------------------------

1) Install KPP. Please refer to the readme file in kpp archive file for instructions

2) Install a Fortran compiler (preferably ifort, alternatively gfortran) and the netcdf libraries

---

3) Generate the mechanism files in src/mech, run make

4) Edit the Makefile (in main directory), set the correct path to the netcdf libraries and include file. Depending on netcdf distribution, use "-lnetcdf" or "-lnetcdf -lnetcdff"

5) in directories.f , set the appropriate path to Mistra input files. It is advised to use a directory that will not be duplicated for each version the user will run, but choose a generic directory instead.

6) Compile the code and run the executable "mistra"
